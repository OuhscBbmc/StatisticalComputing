Stub for David Bard's Presentation:

Getting Started with Bayesian GLMMs in R, SAS, Mplus, & WinBUGS
------------------

(*Slides are coming soon*)

> We will compare and contrast Bayesian estimation packages/procedures for running generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) in R, SAS, Mplus, and WinBUGS/OpenBUGS.  Linear and logistic examples will be presented along with graphing options for evaluating model fit.
