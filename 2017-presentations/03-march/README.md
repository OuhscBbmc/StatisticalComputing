SCUG meeting: 2017-03-08

Creating a minimal R package: initializing package skeleton
===========

1. We’ll establish a minimal R package that serves as a stable platform for you to deploy your own functions to multiple projects and people.  
1. In the first meeting (on March 7), 
    * I hope to get through the steps described here: https://github.com/wibeasley/r-package-skeleton/blob/master/documentation-for-developers/initializing-package.md
    * In the middle of the first meeting, we’ll spend 15 minutes on branching, merging, and rebasing Git repositories.  Software developers use this approach to (a) isolate beta features from a stable master branch, and (b) facilitate work across multiple developers in parallel.  We'll work from https://github.com/wibeasley/class-branching.
1. For the second meeting (April 4), 
    * you’ll add your own functions to the package, and we’ll tackle some tricky problems together.
    * We’ll cover more complicated branching/rebasing scenarios
1. For both meetings, 
    * please bring your laptops,
    * ideally with the prerequisite software installed (ie, R, RStudio, RTools, & GitHub Desktop): https://github.com/wibeasley/r-package-skeleton/blob/master/documentation-for-developers/initializing-package.md#prerequisites
1. This hands-on discussion follows the material in two repos:
    * https://github.com/wibeasley/r-package-skeleton
    * https://github.com/wibeasley/class-branching.
