Learning Python Programming Language in Interactive Computing Framework
=======================================

In this meeting, we will learn key differences about two versions of Python, how to use Jupyter Notebook, Python essentials (variables, expressions, statements, conditional execution, functions, iteration, strings, little bit of files etc.), and compare few commands of Python with R programming language.

We will be using Python 3.x and it can be downloaded here and installed easily: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

Also, we will use Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.org/) to learn Python in this meeting. Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive computing, creating and sharing documents with codes, graphs, and texts. Please follow this page http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html  to install Jupyter Notebook using command prompt/terminal (See Using pip section). Please bring your laptop for some hands-on experience. It will be helpful if you have any text-editor installed on your laptop.
