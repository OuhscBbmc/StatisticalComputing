File Repository for the *Statistical Computing User Group*
============
Welcome to the file repository for the OUHSC's *Statistical Computing User Group*.  Our regular meeting time is now the first Tuesday in each month.

This directory contains code and materials from previous presentations at the  (formerly called the SAS/R User Group).  A summary of the 2013 presentations can be [found here](./2013_Presentations/).

*(Dave & Mike, I'm going to see what we can reuse from the D2L site, and work from there).*

If you are interested in attending or presenting, please contact [Will Beasley](william-beasley@ouhsc.edu).  The group is open to anyone interested in the tools used by statisticians and research methodologists. The user group's steering committee is Dave Thompson, Mike Anderson, and Will Beasley.  Suggestions for future meetings are welcome.
