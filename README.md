File Repository for the *Statistical Computing User Group*
============
Welcome to the file repository for the OUHSC's *Statistical Computing User Group*.  Our regular meeting time is now the first Tuesday of each month.  

Our goal is to facilitate the use of statistical and methodological tools and promote collaboration, mentorship, and discussion of research and analysis.

The code and material from previous presentations in the user group  (formerly called the SAS/R User Group) can be accessed here:  
 * [2014 presentations](./2014_Presentations/).
 * [2013 presentations](./2013_Presentations/).
 * [2012 presentations](./2012_Presentations/).

Currently, we meet the first Tuesday of each month, 10:30-11:30am, in the East Boardroom of the Samis Education Center in Children's Hospital.  Driving and parking directions are [here](https://raw.github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/master/Documents/Parking.png).  Once inside the main entrance (which is Level 2), head slightly to the right and take an elevator down to Level 1.  Exit the elevator and turn left; pass through the Samis doors.  The [East Board Room](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/blob/master/Documents/SamisEdCenterMap.pdf?raw=true) will be the first room you see.  Please join us.  Electrical outlets and OUHSC Wi-Fi will be available.

If you are interested in attending or presenting, please contact [Will Beasley](william-beasley@ouhsc.edu).  The group is open to anyone interested in the tools used by statisticians and research methodologists. The user group's steering committee is Dave Thompson, Mike Anderson, and Will Beasley.  Suggestions for future meetings are welcome.
