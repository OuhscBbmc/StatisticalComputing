Welcome to the file repository for the OUHSC's *Statistical Computing User Group*
============

This directory contains code and materials from previous presentations at the *Statistical Computing User Group* (formerly called the SAS/R User Group).  A summary of the 2013 presentations can be [found here](./2013_Presentations/).

*(Dave & Mike, I'm going to see what we can reuse from the D2L site, and work from there).*

If you are interested in attending or presenting, please contact [Will Beasley](william-beasley@ouhsc.edu).  The group is open to anyone interested in the methods used by statisticians and methodologists. The user group's steering committee is Dave Thompson, Mike Anderson, and Will Beasley.  Suggestions for future meetings are welcome.
