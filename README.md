File Repository for the *Statistical Computing User Group*
============
Welcome to the file repository for the OUHSC's *Statistical Computing User Group*.  Starting in the fall of 2014, our regular meeting time is 9:15-10:15am on the first Tuesday of each month.  (And for the fall semester, we’ll provide breakfast, including bagels, muffins, and juice.)

Our goal is to facilitate the use of statistical and methodological tools and promote collaboration, mentorship, and discussion of research and analysis.

The code and material from previous presentations in the user group  (formerly called the SAS/R User Group) can be accessed here:  
 * [2014 presentations](./2014_Presentations/).
 * [2013 presentations](./2013_Presentations/).
 * [2012 presentations](./2012_Presentations/).

The group is open to anyone interested in the tools used by statisticians and research methodologists. If you would like to present, please contact [Will Beasley](william-beasley@ouhsc.edu).  We encourage any students or employees to participate or present . Alternatively, tell us if there’s a technique that would help your research or assignments, and we’ll try to arrange an expert to teach us about it.

The group's steering committee is Dave Thompson, Mike Anderson, and Will Beasley.

We meet in the East Boardroom of the Samis Education Center in Children's Hospital.  Driving and parking directions are [here](https://raw.github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/master/Documents/Parking.png).  Once inside the main entrance (which is Level 2), head slightly to the right and take an elevator down to Level 1.  Exit the elevator and turn left; pass through the Samis doors.  The [East Board Room](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing/blob/master/Documents/SamisEdCenterMap.pdf?raw=true) will be the first room you see.  Please join us.  Electrical outlets and OUHSC Wi-Fi are available.
